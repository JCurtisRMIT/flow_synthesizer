### Dependencies

#### Python

Code has been developed with `Python 3.7`. It should work with other versions of `Python 3`, but has not been tested. Moreover, we rely on several third-party libraries, listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). They can be installed with

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

As our experiments are coded in PyTorch, no additional library is required to run them on GPU (provided you already have CUDA installed).


#### RenderMan

### Usage

The code is mostly divided into two scripts `train.py` and `evaluate.py`. The first script `train.py` allows to train a model from scratch as described in the paper. The second script `evaluate.py` allows to generate the figures of the papers, and also all the supporting additional materials visible on the [supporting page](https://acids-ircam.github.io/flow_synthesizer)) of this repository.

#### train.py arguments
```

### Models details

As discussed in the paper, the very large amount of baseline models implemented did not allow to provide all the parameters for reference models (which are defined in the source code). However, we provide these details inside the documentation page in the [models details section](https://acids-ircam.github.io/flow_synthesizer/#models-details)
